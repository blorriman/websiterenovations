                  â€¦ a man who has been attempting to puzzle out the secrets of
                  human existence for his entire life. Some progress may have
                  been made, and some of it has been written down. Other bits
                  come out in front of crowds, sometimes at random times and
                  sometimes in front of groups that intended to be there to hear
                  about it.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  His first published book, Making It Happen, detailed the
                  trials and tribulations of practical project management. The
                  book was written as a novel, and despite (or perhaps because
                  of) the subject matter, it went on to sell more than 45,000
                  copies in Canada, the US, and around the world. A training
                  program based on these principles now has more than 15,000
                  graduates worldwide.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  His second book, The Performance Principle continues the story
                  and provides perspective on what motivates people and how to
                  work with that.
